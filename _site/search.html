        "content": "We’ve found that with all these new tech toys and social media platforms, there are so many distractions in the world of real estate.To help hone their focus, I have our agents sit down and write out the top three areas they want to focus on in their business. Once they figure out what they want to do, whether it be FSBOs, expireds, internet leads, or working by referral, we challenge them to divert their focus to those three areas. If they’re a new agent, we ask them to pick three pillars of business that they think they’d like.We have different advanced courses where we can break up the year, but concentrating on three areas is a good way of keeping things simple.But what does it mean to focus?For our part, my team likes to come into the office, get their things ready, do a quick team huddle to see how things are going, and then do a little bit of script and role-play practice.“Focusing on new business and new client acquisition are both key to maintaining success.”From 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Monday to Friday, also called our “power hour,” our focus is on the phones, where we call our internet leads and personal spheres to work referrals. During that time, we also write handwritten notes to thank our clients and those who are referred to us.After the power hour, we go over scripts and role playing again, just to see how things when.From there on out, the agents go off to do whatever they need for the rest of the day—listing appointments, buyer appointments, inspections, and so on. The great thing about this system is that by the time our agents are free to go out and complete their tasks, they’ll already have done the most important thing of the day, which is focusing on new business and new client acquisition. Both are key to maintaining success.If you have any questions about focusing on what matters the most in our business, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you. ",

        "content": "How does one become a top producer in Colorado Springs? Today I’ll share my own story.Schedule a free business consultationSelling your Colorado home? Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleI got my start in real estate back in 2003, when I had just moved back to Colorado Springs and didn’t have a lot of prospects. Through grit, determination, and the help of my mentor and father, Brian Daniels, I learned the ropes.My father told me that he wouldn’t give me a business, but would instead make me earn it. The interesting thing was that everyone he knew was already on his list of clients, meaning that I’d have to create a whole new sphere of influence.When I started out selling homes, I was working mostly through referrals, making calls, writing notes, pop-bys, and expanding my sphere. I would ask the people I contacted “If you had a family member or friend who was going to buy a home, do you have a Realtor you would refer to them?” That way, I could avoid asking them directly if they were planning to sell their home—doing that on a regular basis might have inclined them to start avoiding my calls and emails.Building my business came down to setting goals and then working backward from there. I would decide how many homes I wanted to sell, come up with a gameplan, and set myself to work every morning and afternoon answering calls and emails.To be a top producer, it takes a couple things beyond just grit, determination, and professionalism. I recommend those who want to become high-level agents in the industry to get their education. I don’t just mean the continuing education that the state requires, but also diving in deep to learn more about the industry. Classes are available at title companies and seminars for you to delve into certain topics to enhance your business.“Building my business came down to setting goals and then working backward from there.”Additionally, once it’s within your budget, you might consider traveling to other areas of the country for conferences, networking, and coaching from other top producers around the nation. I’ve had many different coaches throughout the years, and I definitely recommend serious agents find their own mentors to learn from their knowledge and expertise.Doing this myself, I’ve managed to build up an agent network from which I get referrals. It’s also how I started to build my own team, which allowed us to do more expansive marketing campaigns to garner more leads.To be a top producer in Colorado Springs, you also need to learn how to play nicely with others. Yes, we do represent our clients’ best interests, but there’s a certain way that high-level agents need to handle themselves during transactions. When we work peer-to-peer and Realtor-to-Realtor, we want to maintain a professional relationship. The MLS is, after all, a cooperative resource that is best utilized when we all work well together.Ultimately, if you make goals, find a mentor or coach, work hard, start with people you know to build your database, and continue in that fashion, you can become a top producer in the field.If you have any questions or need any advice about how to advance your own career as an agent, please feel free to reach out to me. Indeed, that’s why I started this brokerage: I wanted to help more agents reach their goals.",

        "content": "Events are perfect for bringing together your clients, and there are many effective ones you can consider.Schedule a free business consultationSelling your Colorado home? Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleI hear this question a lot from my fellow agents: Should I hold client events?Absolutely! If you want to grow your referral base, these events are crucial. We do four major events each year, but you don’t need a huge budget to host something great. Starting out with a simple happy hour gathering for your best clients can be a great way to test the waters. Then, you can focus on bigger, better events for your entire client list.Here are some of the things we like to do:A chocolate giveaway in February alongside a party in our officeA family-friendly night at the movies in June where we rent out multiple theatersA barbecue extravaganza in August where we go all out with big giveaways, plenty of food, and fun for allA pie giveaway around Thanksgiving“You don’t need a huge budget to host something great.”It’s always good to have small get-togethers to supplement these big events. Take your biggest clients and go golfing, attend a sporting event, etc. Don’t overspend, and absolutely do not forget to follow up after these events. Thank them for coming, share pictures of the event, and so on.If you have any questions or need further information about making your business more successful, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Finding great listing leads isn’t as hard as you think. These are the four best sources you should know about.Schedule a free business consultationSelling your Colorado home? Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleToday I’m excited to talk about some of the top sources for listing leads. Here’s my list for all of the other agents out there:1. Sphere and past clients. I can’t stress this enough. Embrace and engage with your sphere and past clients. When you talk to them, make sure they know you’re never too busy for their referrals.2. A network of agents. 10 years ago, this was a lot harder to do because you had to do it in person. With the advent of social media, it’s much easier. I do recommend meeting people in person when you can, but it really makes sense to reach out to agents in communities where military homebuyers are coming into Colorado Springs. Do your research and start finding these Realtors on Facebook and LinkedIn.3+4. FSBO/Expired. A lot of people don’t like working these lists, but they should. These are two groups of people who you already know want to sell their home. In the last year, we’ve seen more people using a Realtor than in the previous 10+ years. Things are getting a little bit more complicated in terms of marketing, so these types of home sellers want expert advice. Nine times out of 10, I find that expired listings happen because of the previous agent’s error. The key is to pick one strategy and stick to it. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects. Just find a system and stick to it.“Building a network of agents is much easier these days.”If you have any questions about any of these strategies or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I’d love to hear from you.",

You’ll then take a test a become a licensed real estate agent. Here in Colorado Springs, there are several in-person programs you can choose from. My agents have found success in Kaplan, and I personally recommend this option. On top of in-person classes, they also have an online component and correspondence courses. Other real estate schools usually have these components as well.“Agents who take the online and correspondence routes struggle to pass their tests.”However, I’ve found that agents who take the online and correspondence routes struggle to pass their tests. This is primarily because they’re missing out on vital interaction with an instructor and other benefits of the classroom setting. Correspondence courses, where students are essentially just reading a book, show high failure rates. The online component fares a bit better, but neither option compares to the in-person experience.Kaplan’s in-person courses see students passing the first or second time, compared to other options where tests are often retaken multiple times. If you want to be better prepared for the final exam, you want to devote three weeks and show up to an in-person class.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to contact us.

Others like to have their office in an office. Here at RE/MAX Millennium, we offer both options. Either way, you’ll find a great work environment, and in our office, we have a cafe space, inviting decor, and a wonderful administrative team to support all our clients.In any case, here are a couple tips to help you ensure a productive work environment.“CREATE A PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT.”If you work from home and that’s important to you, you should treat your workday just like you would anywhere else. If you’d wear a suit and tie to the office, wear a suit and tie at home. Dress how you’d normally dress, whether you have an appointment or not. Otherwise, you might find yourself sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos watching TV when you should be prospecting.It’s also important to have a regimented schedule when you work from home. If you have small children at home or you don’t have your own workspace there, you need to make sure you have a space in the office where you can actually get work done. Stay focused and don’t let yourself get distracted by emails or your smartphone (it’s not so “smart” if it’s distracting you).Studies have shown that there’s no such thing as multitasking, so take 60- to 90-minute periods throughout the day to focus on one thing. I promise you that if you do this, your productivity will increase, and I have plenty of other productivity hacks that I’d be happy to share with you if you’re interested.If you have any more questions about how to create a productive work environment or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to give me a shout.

However, leveraging platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram (to name just a few), can be quite effective. The key is to be consistent.Make sure that you are posting on a daily or weekly basis, and that your posts are appropriate. While it should mostly be business-related, you can also occasionally include personal touches. This way when people Google your name, they’ll be able to learn a little about you before meeting up with you for a listing appointment.“WHILE IT SHOULD MOSTLY BE BUSINESS-RELATED, YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS CAN ALSO INCLUDE PERSONAL TOUCHES TO HELP POTENTIAL CLIENTS SEE YOU AS A REAL PERSON.”If you want to keep your private Facebook life locked out, that is fine. That said, creating a Realtor Facebook page or business page will greatly benefit your business. And, if you’re comfortable doing so, adding in the personal things to your real estate page will help others see you as a real person.Beyond posting, watch your clients and keep in touch with them to change an online situation into a personal situation. You can wish them a happy birthday or send them gifts when they have a new baby. This is especially important if they are someone who would refer you business. Taking these steps will help you build a long-term relationship.Online interactions with clients can be turned into a source of referral business. The more you do this, the more you are going to win.

The way a team runs under each will be different, and noticeably so.So what is the difference between these concepts?First, managing means that the person in power is simply barking commands. Leading, on the other hand, is all about inspiring those who look to you for guidance.Rather than simply telling people what to do, leading is all about guiding people toward the right decisions. This is the leadership approach that helps teams succeed.“LEAD BY INSPIRATION, NOT BY ORDERS.”For those of you who have a team or are interested in growing one, we would be happy to help you more fully understand how having the right leadership philosophy can benefit a collaborative environment.Giving your team goals and allowing them to be part of the creative process will improve the results you see from their work. Your team members should feel as if you trust them, and as if they have the power to work autonomously toward the team’s larger objectives.As a leader, your task is to educate, guide, and work alongside your team.

Make sure you understand that it’s a time commitment; you might be on a weekly or monthly call or you might get homework assignments. If they’re good, your coach will hold you accountable.You’ll also want to have a clear perspective on your goals. There are different types of coaches who specialize in different areas, so you’ll need to know what you want to learn from them and why before you select one to hire.Finally, you’ll need to reach out and get testimonials from the coach’s clients, or else speak with agents who have worked with them, in order to make sure their process is legitimate and that they have successfully helped agents grow their business.As a coaching expert, I’m happy to sit down with you and help you.

Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleThere are a number of things you can do to increase your productivity without increasing the number of hours you spend working.My first recommendation for boosting productivity is by implementing a tool called “Dominate Your Day”, or DYD. This tool prioritizes your day by listing the six most important dollar-producing activities you should be taking on. The tool also outlines your goals. If you’d like a copy of this, please let me know and I’d be happy to send you a copy.“TIME BLOCKING IS THE GREATEST PRODUCTIVITY BOOSTER I CAN RECOMMEND.”The second recommendation I have for increasing your productivity is carving out your calendar and implementing time blocking. This is a tip you’ve probably heard time and time again, but that’s because it works. Agents who time block can double or even triple their success. Time blocking is as simple as assigning specific tasks to specific hours of each day.For example, my team and I have a huddle from 8:30 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. every single day. Of course, it’s also important to block off time for leisure, family, and vacation. I actually recommend blocking this time off first.

        "content": "Not all content is good content. Today I&rsquo;m sharing how to know the difference and better engage with your sphere. As a real estate agent, we must engage with our sphere regularly. The challenge with that, of course, is crafting meaningful content that provides your clients with value. Here are some tips for content creation: Educate your audience about the housing market, real estate, and upcoming listings. Highlight interesting trends in the housing market and offer expert analysis and predictions. We don’t want to just repeatedly send them listings—they can look for those elsewhere. While it’s important to occasionally send them listings so that they know you’re actively involved in the business, adding the extra touch of, say, a video blog or an interesting social media post can be impactful. “Don’t overrun your personal social media page with business.”Obviously, whatever you send through—whether via postcards in the U.S. mail or newsletters via email—should be carefully thought out. There’s an infamous story about an agent who sent out recipe cards for 10 years, only to find out that someone in their sphere all along chose a different Realtor for their home sale. When confronted, the person told this agent, “Oops, I forgot you were a Realtor. I thought you were involved with some cooking school.” That story illustrates the importance of keeping your content industry-related. On your personal social media accounts, follow this general rule: Make one business post for every three to four personal posts. Don’t overrun your personal page with business, as it will likely annoy your friends and potential clients. Buyers and sellers, millennials especially, want to see that you’re a real person and not some scam; you need to be active on the most popular social media platforms. On them, you can highlight local businesses or plug upcoming client events. Truly, there’s no limit to the amount of valuable information you can share with your sphere. Please reach out via phone, email, or the links below. I’d be happy to talk with you about how to best contact your sphere and strengthen your business relationships. ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How do you ask for referrals? Today I&rsquo;ll share my tips and best practices. If you’re reluctant to ask for more referrals, there are a few simple things you can try to increase your referral business.First, have a conversation with your friends and family. Ask if they know anyone interested in buying or selling property.  If they do, do they have a Realtor to help them? This way, you’re letting them know that you’re looking for referrals, which might be easier to get from a trusted source.You can also ask past clients for referrals. It’s important to let them know at the very beginning of the transaction that you work by referral and remind them through the process. To increase the frequency with which you can get referrals from past clients, make sure their experience is superior. “Be sure to reach out consistently throughout the process.”Research shows when someone is looking for a specific thing, like a car, they’ll start to see it everywhere. Similarly, when someone is shopping for a home, their ears are always open for conversations about real estate, be it at work, church, or wherever. Transactions can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days, so be sure to reach out consistently throughout the process. I can’t tell you how much that has helped my business grow. Other things, like handwritten notes and even housecalls, can help you get referrals, as well.If you have any questions about getting more referrals, we offer training courses here at RE/MAX Millennium. Feel free to reach out to us to schedule a consultation or to address any other questions you have.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are a few quick tips that will help you get more reviews. We all know that with the advent of social media and the rise of sites like Yelp and Zillow, reviews have become increasingly important to real estate agents. What’s the key to getting more, better reviews, though?First, you need to provide the best customer service possible. This is an obvious tip, but you need to be professional and follow up with people. The very first time you meet with them, tell them you appreciate their time and that you’ll be asking for a review toward the end of the process. I know you like to get reviews on different platforms, but I recommend picking just two or three of them. In addition to Zillow and Yelp, Google and Facebook are good options. We’ve found that if you ask them for a review right before closing (not at closing—that should be about them), they’re more willing to give you one. If you ask for one after the closing, it might be a while before you get one because at that point they’re more concerned with unpacking and settling into their new home. “You need to be professional and follow up with people.”Another good way to get reviews is to hold a contest centered around them. You can’t just ask for a five-star review—federal law prohibits that—but you can offer prizes like an overnight hotel stay or an iPad for any past clients who write you a review. All you have to do is send out a video just like this one where you thank them for their business and ask them for honest reviews on the platforms you’ve already picked. You’d be surprised at how many you can get. Before you do this, though, check with your broker to make sure you’re not breaking any federal or state laws. The next time you host a client party, you can also ask past clients to write a review before they attend. These are just a few ideas to keep in mind, but if you’d like to talk more about this subject, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to schedule a consultation with you and do everything I can to help generate the best reviews possible. ",

        "content": "Whether or not you should use a dialer depends on the marketing you do.&nbsp;Should you use a dialer? In case you don’t know, a dialer is a system that automatically dials lists for you. It helps you be more efficient, and most of them have a built-in CRM, as well, so you can track notes. If you want to get really fancy, you can buy a triple-line dialer that can call three people at a time. In any case, whether you should use a dialer or not depends on the type of marketing you do. If you’re just reaching out to your sphere and checking in with them, you don’t really need one. It might help if you have 300 or 400 clients and you need to call all of them for a single event, though. “Dialers are typically meant for circle prospecting and cold calling.”Otherwise, dialers are typically meant for circle prospecting and cold calling—any scenario that involves reaching out to a large volume of people. The system I like to use is called Mojo Dialer, but I’ve also used the RedX Storm® Dialer.If you’d like to know more about specific dialers my team and I use, and how we use them, give me a call. They’re a handy tool to have to make your business more efficient. If you don’t need to make a lot of large dials, though, you’ll be fine focusing on your sphere by just picking up your phone the old-fashioned way. As always, if you have questions about any other topic, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you. ",

It’s our professional duty to focus on understanding our clients’ needs, and by learning scripts, we can listen to their needs when they’re talking to us instead of trying to think of what to say next. “If you’re able to answer your clients’ objections professionally they’ll know that you know what you’re talking about.”If you’d like to see some of the scripts my team and I use, use this link to schedule a consultation. We practice our scripts daily, and we have different scripts for all types of clients and objections. Like I said, you don’t want to sound canned, which is why I advise that you keep the key elements of the script the same, but alter your responses so they feel like they’re coming from you.If you’re able to answer your clients’ objections professionally they’ll know that you know what you’re talking about. By sounding more professional, you’ll have more success converting your clients. If you have more questions about the value of scripts or you have any other real estate needs at all, feel free to call or email me.

        "content": "Today&rsquo;s message is about how to prospect expired leads. Today I want to discuss how to go about prospecting expired leads. If you don’t have a large sphere of clients, going after expired listings is one of the lowest-hanging fruits you can grab at. The basic method of getting expired listings is consistent followups. The number one way real estate agents get in touch with expired listings is by simply calling them. “Whatever you do, you need to be consistent.”There are multiple services out there like REDX or Vulcan7 that you can subscribe to for a fairly affordable rate, and they’ll deliver to you, through their site or your email, expired listings from that day. You can also go back and see past expired listings to call. There are different methods you can employ, but that first day you should reach out three to five times by phone. The second approach is mailing postcards or letters. There are different systems, coaches, and so on you can buy, but find one that works for you. Whatever you do, you need to be consistent. Don’t just call them the day the listing expires, you want to follow up every day or every other day with a text, call, or email. You can find out more information about them by just looking on Facebook. We call that research, it’s not stalking. Do your homework. The most aggressive way that I’ve heard of is literally going and knocking on the door. Devise an explanation of how you’re great at selling homes that didn’t sell the first time and create a pre-listing package. Frequently my team and I are the second or third Realtors people come to, and we share our success stories with them of how we were able to sell former clients’ homes for full price in 30 days when it was expired once or twice before. Share how you’re different from their last Realtor and can be trusted. Show them your value. They don’t necessarily need to know how many homes you’ve sold, they want to know you care and that you’re going to be there for them and not leave them hanging like their previous Realtor. Feel free to pick up the phone and call or stop by the office and I can show you what we do to find expired leads. Also, reach out by phone or email with questions or go to our website and schedule a consultation. I’d love to meet with you. ",

Let&rsquo;s talk about why. When you send out content to your farm, the information you send them should be a little different from the things you send your sphere, in general. This is because farms are restricted to a geographic area, whereas your sphere is just a collection of people you’ve connected with. Therefore, the content you send your farm should be a reflection of where they live. This might mean sending out a newsletter detailing area sales activity, video market updates, or notices about local events. “The content you send your farm should be a reflection of where they live.”People tend to be most interested in content that relates to their neighborhood, which can work to your advantage as an agent if you happen to have any listings in the area.

Depending on the size of the farm, it might be more feasible to do more or less. If you’re just starting a farm that includes between 50 and 300 people, you’ll probably want to have more contacts. If you’re farming a wider area, you may not be able to have as many contacts with your base.Here’s what I recommend: Send out something in the physical mail once a month, or once a quarter at a minimum, and if you have the phone numbers from your farm, try getting in touch with each person four times a year. You could also try walking through the neighborhood to do some door-knocking; this will also help you get to know the community.If you have any questions about the specific content that we send out to our farms or anything else related to keeping in touch with your farm, don’t hesitate to reach out to us for a consultation.

There are a lot of websites (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.) that allow you to do this, in addition to the local MLS. Also, whenever we do an open house, we email every agent who has sold a home in that ZIP code and invite them and their clients to attend. Additionally, we use paid advertisements for the property on Facebook.“The days of just placing an ad in the newspaper and putting up a few signs are over.”After that, we call residents in the surrounding neighborhood and invite them over. If we have time, we’ll knock on the doors of the same houses we’re calling and hand these people a personalized invitation.Sometimes, we’ll host a private open house for neighbors only, which allows our agents to meet with them before the general public is invited. The people who attend this pre-open house might be thinking about selling themselves and are on the lookout for a good agent, so not only are you attracting traffic to your current listing, but you’re also attracting other future seller clients.If you have any more questions about how to generate traffic for your open house, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

In my packets, I provide information that details the benefits of hiring me and what they can expect when working with me. This way, they have most of their questions already answered before we meet face to face and we can get down to business and get the listing agreement signed. “If you haven’t already, put together a pre-listing packet you can give to buyers that outlines the benefits of working with you.”So if you haven’t already, put together a pre-listing packet you can give to buyers that outlines the benefits of working with you. Don’t talk about why you’re the top agent in the area or ramble about how many homes you’ve sold—stick to what kind of value you provide them. Second, be on time. If you show up just five minutes late to an appointment, you’re in trouble. I recommend showing up at least five to 10 minutes early and then, at the agreed-upon time, knocking on the door and introducing yourself. If the seller is speaking to other agents, there’s a chance some of them will be late to their appointments, so they’ll be impressed with your punctuality. Lastly, don’t spend too much time in the seller’s home unless they have a lot of questions. Some agents like to spend half a day in their would-be client’s home, but they’re not planning on you spending a half-day there. Keep things professional, build a rapport, and ask for a tour of the home so you get a chance to connect with them about something. If you find a connection point, don’t focus on it, because that will distract from the reason you’re there in the first place.If you’d like to talk more about improving your listing presentation, don’t hesitate to give me a call or schedule a consultation.

Find out today. There are many different places an agent can find business, but when it comes to finding listing leads, these four sources stand out above the rest:1. Your sphere of influence. Staying in touch with your sphere of influence is incredibly powerful. You must always let them know that you’re never too busy to take on their real estate needs, or their referrals.2. Your professional network. Over time, real estate professionals build a lot of relationships with fellow Realtors from all over the country. By maintaining these relationships, you’re likely to attract referrals from agents who have been approached by clients looking to buy or sell outside of their market. This is especially effective in areas with military bases, which attract a large number of out-of-state families.“The demand for professional help in the real estate industry has never been higher.”3. FSBO sellers. People who are interested in selling their property on their own generally end up needing more help than they expected. Studies show that more people have turned to Realtors for professional help than was true during any given year over the last decade. Although listing online has become easier for sellers to manage on their own, the rest of the home selling process has become more complex. The demand for professional help in the real estate industry has never been higher.4. People who have previously failed to sell. The biggest mistake someone who has failed to sell in the past can make is to try the same approach again. Working with a new agent (like you) will be in their best interest, and if you can convince them of this, you’ll find that this demographic of sellers is an incredible source of leads.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

I’m often asked this question by fledgling business owners, and it’s no wonder: Entrepreneurship comes with its fair share of risks. Because of that, developing good habits and practices right from the word go is very important.Above all, success in your entrepreneurial pursuits depends on your determination. You need to make sure you’re determined to achieve the goals you set out to achieve. More than just fame or fortune, it’s about your value proposition. If the value of what you’re selling goes above and beyond what people are paying for it, you’re sure to succeed.In one of my previous videos, I discussed the importance of being an early riser and sticking to a morning routine, which is a key ingredient in your success as an entrepreneur as well. If you missed it, you can check it out here.“If the value of what you’re selling goes above and beyond what people are paying for it, you’re sure to succeed.”In addition, I’d recommend reading the book “Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business” by Gino Wickman. In it, he provides a blueprint for strategic planning and setting quarterly “rocks” or goals. Whether you’re just now getting your business off the ground or you want to take it to the next level, reading this book will help you map out where you want to go.Your focus will also be instrumental to your success. The more you focus on fine-tuning your sales and marketing, the more your focus will expand to not only reach the people who know, like, and trust you, but to create new lines of communication with people in the marketplace.You’re probably wondering how many hours a week you’ll have to dedicate. It’s important to discipline yourself to treat entrepreneurship as a job. When you’re first starting out, you can probably expect to work 10 to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week. Eventually, you’ll need to return to a healthy work-life balance, but in the short term, being an entrepreneur will demand your undivided attention and a lot of time, energy, and effort.If you have any questions about today’s topic or you’d like to schedule a one-on-one consultation, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Having a follow-up strategy in place is key to converting internet leads. What is your plan for converting internet leads? The answer boils down to three factors: your immediate, mid-term, and long-term follow up. Statistics say that the average buyer starts looking at homes online two years before they’re actually ready to buy. Here in the Colorado Springs area, the average is closer to six to 12 months, but we still have some buyers who need to buy sooner than that (i.e., within the next 30 to 60 days).How does our team handle these types of leads?Let’s start with our immediate follow-up. In this case, we reach out to someone within five to 10 minutes of registering on our website. Whether it’s an ISA or an agent, they’ll call between three to five times that day without leaving a voicemail. If you leave a voicemail, the potential buyer may tag your number and block it, or just never call you back. We try and spread out these phone calls throughout the day.“Your goal should be consistent follow up—the leads work when you work.”We also follow up via text and email—a lot of clients that we’re able to convert started with a text message conversation. I won’t say whether this is a generational trend, but a lot of people prefer to respond to a text than a call.Our mid-term follow up is for buyers who, once we make contact with them, indicate that they’re ready to buy within 60 to 90 days. In the meantime, we reach out to them about once a week and build up our rapport.Our long-term follow up is for buyers who want to buy after 90 days, and we typically reach out to them twice a month with a text or email.It’s best to have a CRM in place to track these leads, and there are dozens of good ones out there that you can choose from. Your goal should be consistent follow up—the leads work when you work.If you have any questions about this topic or need help with your follow-up strategy, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

It’s not all about the money or the fame; it’s about serving others. If you can provide a value for someone that’s higher than what they’re already paying for, then you’re going to be a true success.It takes a lot of grit— you have to grind every single day, starting by forming a strong morning routine. Learn more about that here in a recent video we did.Another lesson I take with me is from the book “Traction” by Gino Wickman. In a nutshell, it talks about being successful in a strategic way. You have to make quarterly goals to move your business forward and if you don’t, things will remain stagnant.“It takes a lot of grit and you have to grind daily.”For real estate, you need to make sure you’re contacting clients, people who know you, and new people.

Search all homes for saleI got my start in real estate back in 2003, when I had just moved back to Colorado Springs and didn’t have a lot of prospects. Through grit, determination, and the help of my mentor and father, Brian Daniels, I learned the ropes.My father told me that he wouldn’t give me a business, but would instead make me earn it. The interesting thing was that everyone he knew was already on his list of clients, meaning that I’d have to create a whole new sphere of influence.When I started out selling homes, I was working mostly through referrals, making calls, writing notes, pop-bys, and expanding my sphere. I would ask the people I contacted “If you had a family member or friend who was going to buy a home, do you have a Realtor you would refer to them?” That way, I could avoid asking them directly if they were planning to sell their home—doing that on a regular basis might have inclined them to start avoiding my calls and emails.Building my business came down to setting goals and then working backward from there. I would decide how many homes I wanted to sell, come up with a gameplan, and set myself to work every morning and afternoon answering calls and emails.To be a top producer, it takes a couple things beyond just grit, determination, and professionalism. I recommend those who want to become high-level agents in the industry to get their education. I don’t just mean the continuing education that the state requires, but also diving in deep to learn more about the industry. Classes are available at title companies and seminars for you to delve into certain topics to enhance your business.“Building my business came down to setting goals and then working backward from there.”Additionally, once it’s within your budget, you might consider traveling to other areas of the country for conferences, networking, and coaching from other top producers around the nation. I’ve had many different coaches throughout the years, and I definitely recommend serious agents find their own mentors to learn from their knowledge and expertise.Doing this myself, I’ve managed to build up an agent network from which I get referrals. It’s also how I started to build my own team, which allowed us to do more expansive marketing campaigns to garner more leads.To be a top producer in Colorado Springs, you also need to learn how to play nicely with others. Yes, we do represent our clients’ best interests, but there’s a certain way that high-level agents need to handle themselves during transactions. When we work peer-to-peer and Realtor-to-Realtor, we want to maintain a professional relationship. The MLS is, after all, a cooperative resource that is best utilized when we all work well together.Ultimately, if you make goals, find a mentor or coach, work hard, start with people you know to build your database, and continue in that fashion, you can become a top producer in the field.If you have any questions or need any advice about how to advance your own career as an agent, please feel free to reach out to me. Indeed, that’s why I started this brokerage: I wanted to help more agents reach their goals.",

If you want to grow your referral base, these events are crucial. We do four major events each year, but you don’t need a huge budget to host something great. Starting out with a simple happy hour gathering for your best clients can be a great way to test the waters. Then, you can focus on bigger, better events for your entire client list.Here are some of the things we like to do:A chocolate giveaway in February alongside a party in our officeA family-friendly night at the movies in June where we rent out multiple theatersA barbecue extravaganza in August where we go all out with big giveaways, plenty of food, and fun for allA pie giveaway around Thanksgiving“You don’t need a huge budget to host something great.”It’s always good to have small get-togethers to supplement these big events. Take your biggest clients and go golfing, attend a sporting event, etc. Don’t overspend, and absolutely do not forget to follow up after these events.

Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleToday I’m excited to talk about some of the top sources for listing leads. Here’s my list for all of the other agents out there:1. Sphere and past clients. I can’t stress this enough. Embrace and engage with your sphere and past clients. When you talk to them, make sure they know you’re never too busy for their referrals.2. A network of agents. 10 years ago, this was a lot harder to do because you had to do it in person. With the advent of social media, it’s much easier. I do recommend meeting people in person when you can, but it really makes sense to reach out to agents in communities where military homebuyers are coming into Colorado Springs. Do your research and start finding these Realtors on Facebook and LinkedIn.3+4. FSBO/Expired. A lot of people don’t like working these lists, but they should. These are two groups of people who you already know want to sell their home. In the last year, we’ve seen more people using a Realtor than in the previous 10+ years. Things are getting a little bit more complicated in terms of marketing, so these types of home sellers want expert advice. Nine times out of 10, I find that expired listings happen because of the previous agent’s error. The key is to pick one strategy and stick to it. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects. Just find a system and stick to it.“Building a network of agents is much easier these days.”If you have any questions about any of these strategies or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today.

My agents have found success in Kaplan, and I personally recommend this option. On top of in-person classes, they also have an online component and correspondence courses. Other real estate schools usually have these components as well.“Agents who take the online and correspondence routes struggle to pass their tests.”However, I’ve found that agents who take the online and correspondence routes struggle to pass their tests. This is primarily because they’re missing out on vital interaction with an instructor and other benefits of the classroom setting. Correspondence courses, where students are essentially just reading a book, show high failure rates. The online component fares a bit better, but neither option compares to the in-person experience.Kaplan’s in-person courses see students passing the first or second time, compared to other options where tests are often retaken multiple times. If you want to be better prepared for the final exam, you want to devote three weeks and show up to an in-person class.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to contact us.

Either way, you’ll find a great work environment, and in our office, we have a cafe space, inviting decor, and a wonderful administrative team to support all our clients.In any case, here are a couple tips to help you ensure a productive work environment.“CREATE A PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT.”If you work from home and that’s important to you, you should treat your workday just like you would anywhere else. If you’d wear a suit and tie to the office, wear a suit and tie at home. Dress how you’d normally dress, whether you have an appointment or not. Otherwise, you might find yourself sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos watching TV when you should be prospecting.It’s also important to have a regimented schedule when you work from home. If you have small children at home or you don’t have your own workspace there, you need to make sure you have a space in the office where you can actually get work done. Stay focused and don’t let yourself get distracted by emails or your smartphone (it’s not so “smart” if it’s distracting you).Studies have shown that there’s no such thing as multitasking, so take 60- to 90-minute periods throughout the day to focus on one thing.

The way a team runs under each will be different, and noticeably so.So what is the difference between these concepts?First, managing means that the person in power is simply barking commands. Leading, on the other hand, is all about inspiring those who look to you for guidance.Rather than simply telling people what to do, leading is all about guiding people toward the right decisions. This is the leadership approach that helps teams succeed.“LEAD BY INSPIRATION, NOT BY ORDERS.”For those of you who have a team or are interested in growing one, we would be happy to help you more fully understand how having the right leadership philosophy can benefit a collaborative environment.Giving your team goals and allowing them to be part of the creative process will improve the results you see from their work.

I’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on coaching, and I’m prepared to give you access to that pool of knowledge.“I OFFER COACHING TO ANY AGENTS WHO WANT TO COME TO MY OFFICE.”However, if you want to hire a coach, just be aware that it can be costly. Make sure you understand that it’s a time commitment; you might be on a weekly or monthly call or you might get homework assignments. If they’re good, your coach will hold you accountable.You’ll also want to have a clear perspective on your goals. There are different types of coaches who specialize in different areas, so you’ll need to know what you want to learn from them and why before you select one to hire.Finally, you’ll need to reach out and get testimonials from the coach’s clients, or else speak with agents who have worked with them, in order to make sure their process is legitimate and that they have successfully helped agents grow their business.As a coaching expert, I’m happy to sit down with you and help you. If you have a question about a specific coach, I’ve done research on almost all of them, and I’d gladly share my thoughts with you. Please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I hope to hear from you soon.",

Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleThere are a number of things you can do to increase your productivity without increasing the number of hours you spend working.My first recommendation for boosting productivity is by implementing a tool called “Dominate Your Day”, or DYD. This tool prioritizes your day by listing the six most important dollar-producing activities you should be taking on. The tool also outlines your goals. If you’d like a copy of this, please let me know and I’d be happy to send you a copy.“TIME BLOCKING IS THE GREATEST PRODUCTIVITY BOOSTER I CAN RECOMMEND.”The second recommendation I have for increasing your productivity is carving out your calendar and implementing time blocking. This is a tip you’ve probably heard time and time again, but that’s because it works. Agents who time block can double or even triple their success. Time blocking is as simple as assigning specific tasks to specific hours of each day.For example, my team and I have a huddle from 8:30 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. every single day. Of course, it’s also important to block off time for leisure, family, and vacation. I actually recommend blocking this time off first. Time blocking is the greatest productivity booster I can recommend.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Search all homes for saleShould you text your leads? Well, based on what we’ve found, our team and others are actually getting a far better response rate with texting than with calling.Obviously, we like to call people when we first reach out since voice-to-voice contact still plays an important role. However, these days, most people let their phone go to voicemail.You can call up to three times without leaving a message if you’re bold. They may answer if you are this persistent. But if they don’t, I recommend leaving a voicemail and also following up with a text message saying who you are and that you’d be happy to assist them with their real estate needs.“IF YOU HAVEN’T BEEN DOING SO ALREADY, TEXT THOSE LEADS!”There are text systems you can buy, but your phone is all you really need. If you haven’t been doing so already, text those leads! It will make a big difference in your conversation rate.You can find samples of texts we’ve used to convert leads here, or here.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Get a free home value report  Buying a Colorado home? Search all homes for saleOne of the biggest sources of inspiration and motivation for me is the books that I’ve read. There are a number of books that I can point to that have helped me grow both professionally and personally. I believe that reading is a key to success, which is why I have a library for my team that is always growing. Here are a few of my favorite books that taught me countless lessons about real estate and business in general:• “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill• “Millionaire Real Estate Agent” by Gary Keller• “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie• “The E-Myth” by Michael Gerber• “Eat That Frog!” by Brian Tracy• “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb BlountReading these books will help you take your business and transform it into a career and a lifestyle that will help you build the life you want. These are just a handful at the ones at the top of my list, so if you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them.

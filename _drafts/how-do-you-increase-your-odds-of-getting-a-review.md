We all know that with the advent of social media and the rise of sites like Yelp and Zillow, reviews have become increasingly important to real estate agents. What’s the key to getting more, better reviews, though?

First, **you need to provide the best customer service possible.** This is an obvious tip, but you need to be professional and follow up with people. The very first time you meet with them, tell them you appreciate their time and that you’ll be asking for a review toward the end of the process. I know you like to get reviews on different platforms, but I recommend picking just two or three of them. In addition to Zillow and Yelp, Google and Facebook are good options.&nbsp;

We’ve found that if you ask them for a review right before closing (not at closing—that should be about them), they’re more willing to give you one. If you ask for one after the closing, it might be a while before you get one because at that point they’re more concerned with unpacking and settling into their new home.&nbsp;

Another good way to get reviews is to **hold a contest centered around them.** You can’t just ask for a five-star review—federal law prohibits that—but you can offer prizes like an overnight hotel stay or an iPad for any past clients who write you a review. All you have to do is send out a video just like this one where you thank them for their business and ask them for honest reviews on the platforms you’ve already picked. You’d be surprised at how many you can get. Before you do this, though, check with your broker to make sure you’re not breaking any federal or state laws.&nbsp;

The next time you host a client party, you can also ask past clients to write a review before they attend.&nbsp;

These are just a few ideas to keep in mind, but if you’d like to talk more about this subject, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to schedule a consultation with you and do everything I can to help generate the best reviews possible.&nbsp;

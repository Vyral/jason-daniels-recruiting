Here’s a question for you agents out there: When it comes to your farm, how many touches should you have?

With your sphere of influence, we always encourage you to have 30 or more contacts a year between calls, emails, newsletters, postcards, etc.

For your geographical farm, however, **it’s great to have at least 18 to 24 touches.** Depending on the size of the farm, it might be more feasible to do more or less. If you’re just starting a farm that includes between 50 and 300 people, you’ll probably want to have more contacts. If you’re farming a wider area, you may not be able to have as many contacts with your base.

Here’s what I recommend: Send out something in the physical mail once a month, or once a quarter at a minimum, and **if you have the phone numbers from your farm, try getting in touch with each person four times a year**. You could also try walking through the neighborhood to do some door-knocking; this will also help you get to know the community.

If you have any questions about the specific content that we send out to our farms or anything else related to keeping in touch with your farm, don’t hesitate to reach out to us for a consultation. We’d be happy to talk to you.

How many signs should you put out for an open house, and how do you get people to register? You want to get as much traffic as you can into your open house, and today we’ll be talking about how to do it.&nbsp;

**Typically, we put out between 20 and 30 signs for an open house.** If you can find a shopping center with a grocery store as its central hub, put signs leading from there to the open house. This can nearly double your traffic.&nbsp;

We have metal A-frame signs as well as corrugated plastic signs, which are much more affordable. Keep in mind that you’ll likely lose some signs; cars may run them over, kids could take them, etc.

Place your signs strategically in busy intersections; it also helps to put multiple signs before a turn. This way, people simply can’t miss it.&nbsp;

**At the open house itself, I set up a table where people can register.** I have a bowl where people can enter to win prizes, and we ask for their name, phone number, email, and address. We also say that this is for security purposes, as the seller wants to know who is entering their home.&nbsp;

Have a team present so someone can cover the table while others can show people the home and ensure visitors are acting appropriately.&nbsp;

These tips should help you make the most out of your open houses. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

{% include youtube.html %}The content you send your farm shouldn’t be exactly the same as the content you send your sphere. Let’s talk about why.

When you send out content to your farm, the information you send them should be a little different from the things you send your sphere, in general. This is because **farms are restricted to a geographic area, whereas your sphere is just a collection of people you’ve connected with.&nbsp;**

Therefore, the content you send your farm should be a reflection of where they live. This might mean sending out a newsletter detailing area sales activity, video market updates, or notices about local events.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

**People tend to be most interested in content that relates to their neighborhood**, which can work to your advantage as an agent if you happen to have any listings in the area. If you’re able to secure email addresses from people within your farm, giving them email invites to open houses is another great idea.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

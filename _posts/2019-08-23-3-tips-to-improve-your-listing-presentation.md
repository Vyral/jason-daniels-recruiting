First,&nbsp;**the key to differentiating yourself in our marketplace is providing a pre-listing packet&nbsp;**you either have delivered or deliver yourself to the seller before the meeting. In my packets, I provide information that details the benefits of hiring me and what they can expect when working with me. This way, they have most of their questions already answered before we meet face to face and we can get down to business and get the listing agreement signed.&nbsp;

So if you haven’t already, put together a pre-listing packet you can give to buyers that outlines the benefits of working with you. Don’t talk about why you’re the top agent in the area or ramble about how many homes you’ve sold—stick to what kind of value you provide them.&nbsp;

Second,&nbsp;**be on time**. If you show up just five minutes late to an appointment, you’re in trouble. I recommend showing up at least five to 10 minutes early and then, at the agreed-upon time, knocking on the door and introducing yourself. If the seller is speaking to other agents, there’s a chance some of them will be late to their appointments, so they’ll be impressed with your punctuality.&nbsp;

Lastly,&nbsp;**don’t spend too much time in the seller’s home unless they have a lot of questions.&nbsp;**Some agents like to spend half a day in their would-be client’s home, but they’re not planning on you spending a half-day there. Keep things professional, build a rapport, and ask for a tour of the home so you get a chance to connect with them about something. If you find a connection point, don’t focus on it, because that will distract from the reason you’re there in the first place.

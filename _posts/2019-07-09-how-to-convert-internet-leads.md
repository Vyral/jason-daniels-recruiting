<center><em>Having a follow-up strategy in place is key to converting internet leads.</em></center>

&nbsp;

*What is your plan for converting internet leads? The answer boils down to three factors: **your immediate, mid-term, and long-term follow up.&nbsp;***

*Statistics say that the average buyer starts looking at homes online two years before they’re actually ready to buy. Here in the Colorado Springs area, the average is closer to six to 12 months, but we still have some buyers who need to buy sooner than that (i.e., within the next 30 to 60 days).*

*How does our team handle these types of leads?*

*Let’s start with our immediate follow-up. In this case, we reach out to someone within five to 10 minutes of registering on our website. Whether it’s an ISA or an agent, they’ll call between three to five times that day without leaving a voicemail. If you leave a voicemail, the potential buyer may tag your number and block it, or just never call you back. We try and spread out these phone calls throughout the day.*

***We also follow up via text and email**—a lot of clients that we’re able to convert started with a text message conversation. I won’t say whether this is a generational trend, but a lot of people prefer to respond to a text than a call.*

*Our mid-term follow up is for buyers who, once we make contact with them, indicate that they’re ready to buy within 60 to 90 days. In the meantime, we reach out to them about once a week and build up our rapport.*

*Our long-term follow up is for buyers who want to buy after 90 days, and we typically reach out to them twice a month with a text or email.*

***It’s best to have a CRM in place to track these leads, and there are dozens of good ones out there that you can choose from.** Your goal should be consistent follow up—the leads work when you work.*

*If you have any questions about this topic or need help with your follow-up strategy, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.*

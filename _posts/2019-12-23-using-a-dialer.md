<br>Should you use a dialer?&nbsp;

In case you don’t know, a dialer is a system that automatically dials lists for you. It helps you be more efficient, and most of them have a built-in CRM, as well, so you can track notes. If you want to get really fancy, you can buy a triple-line dialer that can call three people at a time.&nbsp;

In any case, **whether you should use a dialer or not depends on the type of marketing you do.** If you’re just reaching out to your sphere and checking in with them, you don’t really need one. It might help if you have 300 or 400 clients and you need to call all of them for a single event, though.&nbsp;

Otherwise, dialers are typically meant for circle prospecting and cold calling—any scenario that involves reaching out to a large volume of people. The system I like to use is called Mojo Dialer, but I’ve also used the RedX Storm&reg; Dialer.

If you’d like to know more about specific dialers my team and I use, and how we use them, give me a call. They’re a handy tool to have to make your business more efficient. If you don’t need to make a lot of large dials, though, you’ll be fine focusing on your sphere by just picking up your phone the old-fashioned way.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about any other topic, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;

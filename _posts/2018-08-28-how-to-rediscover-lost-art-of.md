With all modern methods of communication available today, like emails, texts, social media, and more, handwritten notes have become a lost art.

Think about it: When is the last time you received a personal, pen-and-paper letter?

Personally, I think reaching out this way is still important. This is why I spend some time each day to write five clients a personal note. Whether it’s an inquiry or simply a message of thanks—there is always a reason to send a handwritten note.

It’s been proven that writing three to five handwritten notes per day will boost your business. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve received a phone call from someone thanking me for taking this extra step in reaching out.

Following this simple tip is an easy, inexpensive way to stay at the top of your clients’ minds, all while increasing the chances that they’ll send referral business your way.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Events are perfect for bringing together your clients, and there are many effective ones you can consider.

I hear this question a lot from my fellow agents: Should I hold client events?

Absolutely! If you want to grow your referral base, these events are crucial. We do four major events each year, but you don’t need a huge budget to host something great. Starting out with a simple happy hour gathering for your best clients can be a great way to test the waters. Then, you can focus on bigger, better events for your entire client list.

Here are some of the things we like to do:

A chocolate giveaway in February alongside a party in our office
A family-friendly night at the movies in June where we rent out multiple theaters
A barbecue extravaganza in August where we go all out with big giveaways, plenty of food, and fun for all
A pie giveaway around Thanksgiving

It’s always good to have small get-togethers to supplement these big events. Take your biggest clients and go golfing, attend a sporting event, etc. Don’t overspend, and absolutely do not forget to follow up after these events. Thank them for coming, share pictures of the event, and so on.

If you have any questions or need further information about making your business more successful, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to helping you.

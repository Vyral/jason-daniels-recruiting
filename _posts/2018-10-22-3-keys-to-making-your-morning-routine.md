If you want to make your morning routine more productive, there are three steps you need to take every day after you wake up.

Follow the three components laid out in the book “The Miracle Morning” by Hal Elrod:

**1. Read (spiritual or motivational reading)**
**2. Exercise**
**3. Coordinate the rest of your day**

This is the same routine that I follow every morning. After I wake up at 5:30, I go to the gym and get a workout in. Then I head back home and read scripture and/or part of whatever motivational book I’m reading at the time. I’m learning more and more about meditation, so that’s also something you could try for this step.

When coordinating your day, sit down and fill out your “Dominate Your Day” sheet that I talked about in a previous video. When you plan your day ahead of time, you can focus on it before it gets away from you.

If you have kids, wake up however early you need to to get this done before they get up. The one thing you don’t want to do first thing in the morning is check your smartphone. If you immediately start checking your emails or logging onto Facebook, that will sidetrack your entire day.

If you’d like to talk more about how you can make your morning routine more productive or you have any other questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.

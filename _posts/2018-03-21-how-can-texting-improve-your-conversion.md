Should you text your leads? Well, based on what we’ve found, our team and others are actually getting a far better response rate with texting than with calling.

Obviously, we like to call people when we first reach out since voice-to-voice contact still plays an important role. However, these days, most people let their phone go to voicemail.

You can call up to three times without leaving a message if you’re bold. They may answer if you are this persistent. But if they don’t, I recommend leaving a voicemail and also following up with a text message saying who you are and that you’d be happy to assist them with their real estate needs.

There are text systems you can buy, but your phone is all you really need. If you haven’t been doing so already, text those leads! It will make a big difference in your conversation rate.

You can find samples of texts we’ve used to convert leads here, or here.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

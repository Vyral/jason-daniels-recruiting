<center>How do you ask for referrals? Today I&rsquo;ll share my tips and best practices.</center>

&nbsp;

If you’re reluctant to ask for more referrals, there are a few simple things you can try to increase your referral business.

First, have a conversation with your friends and family. Ask if they know anyone interested in buying or selling property.&nbsp; If they do, do they have a Realtor to help them? This way, you’re letting them know that you’re looking for referrals, which might be easier to get from a trusted source.

You can also ask past clients for referrals. **It’s important to let them know at the very beginning of the transaction that you work by referral** and remind them through the process. To increase the frequency with which you can get referrals from past clients, make sure their experience is superior.&nbsp;

Research shows when someone is looking for a specific thing, like a car, they’ll start to see it everywhere. Similarly, when someone is shopping for a home, their ears are always open for conversations about real estate, be it at work, church, or wherever.&nbsp;

Transactions can take anywhere from 30 to 90 days, so be sure to reach out consistently throughout the process. I can’t tell you how much that has helped my business grow. Other things, like **handwritten notes and even housecalls, can help you get referrals,** as well.

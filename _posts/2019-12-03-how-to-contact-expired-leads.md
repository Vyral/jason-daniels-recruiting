<center>Today&rsquo;s message is about how to prospect expired leads.</center>

&nbsp;

Today I want to discuss how to go about prospecting expired leads. **One of the lowest-hanging fruits if you don’t have a large sphere of clients is going after expired listings.** The basic method of getting expired listings is consistent followups. The number one way real estate agents get in touch with expired listings is by simply calling them.&nbsp;

There are multiple services out there like REDX or Vulcan7 that you can subscribe to for a fairly affordable rate, and they’ll deliver to you, through their site or your email, expired listings from that day. You can also go back and see past expired listings to call. There are different methods you can employ, but that first day you should reach out three to five times by phone. The second approach is mailing postcards or letters.&nbsp;

There are different systems, coaches, and so on you can buy, but find one that works for you. Whatever you do, you need to be consistent. Don’t just call them the day the listing expires, you want to follow up every day or every other day with a text, call, or email. **You can find out more information about them by just looking on Facebook.** We call that research, it’s not stalking. Do your homework.&nbsp;

The most aggressive way that I’ve heard of is literally going and knocking on the door. Devise an explanation of how you’re great at selling homes that didn’t sell the first time and create a pre-listing package. Frequently my team and I are the second or third Realtors people come to, and we share our success stories with them of how we were able to sell former client’s homes for full price in 30 days when it was expired once or twice before. **Share how you’re different from their last Realtor** and can be trusted. Show them your value. They don’t necessarily need to know how many homes you’ve sold, they want to know you care and that you’re going to be there for them and not leave them hanging like their previous Realtor.&nbsp;

Feel free to pick up the phone and call or stop by the office and I can show you what we do to find expired leads. Also, reach out by phone or email with questions or go to our website and schedule a consultation. I’d love to meet with you.&nbsp;

<center>It&rsquo;s important to learn scripts as an agent, but you shouldn&rsquo;t sound robotic when using them.</center>

&nbsp;

As an agent, you absolutely should use scripts when dealing with clients, but you shouldn’t sound canned when using them.&nbsp;

**It’s important to learn scripts** because real estate boils down to a couple of different buying and selling processes, and the average consumer will have the same questions and objections depending on whether they’re buying or selling.&nbsp;

Once in a while, you’ll get a question or objection you’ve never dealt with, but most agents develop scripts and dialogues to address the majority of their clients’ concerns. It’s our professional duty to focus on understanding our clients’ needs, and by learning scripts, we can listen to their needs when they’re talking to us instead of trying to think of what to say next.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to see some of the scripts my team and I use, use this link to schedule a consultation.** We practice our scripts daily, and we have different scripts for all types of clients and objections. Like I said, you don’t want to sound canned, which is why I advise that you keep the key elements of the script the same, but alter your responses so they feel like they’re coming from *you*.

If you’re able to answer your clients’ objections professionally they’ll know that you know what you’re talking about. By sounding more professional, you’ll have more success converting your clients.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about the value of scripts or you have any other real estate needs at all, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When you’re farming an area, is it better to go wide or deep into that area?&nbsp;**With most agents, I find that it’s better to start by going deep with a small farm and building out from there. &nbsp;**If you have more time than money, it makes sense to go deeper instead of wider at first.

It could be a neighborhood you live in, where your office is, or where your kids go to school.**&nbsp;Pick an area with anywhere from 50 to 300 homes.**&nbsp;You can knock on doors, hand out brochures, and make a connection with the community.

If you already have a presence in your farm and have the money to spend on marketing, you have the luxury of going wide. You can farm a much larger area of thousands of homes by going wide.

**The key focus should be on your budget and your goal.**&nbsp;If you go wide, you can't go as deep if you don’t have a large team helping you. That’s why I encourage going small and deep at first, then start going wider once you know the community better.

If you have any questions for me about farming or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

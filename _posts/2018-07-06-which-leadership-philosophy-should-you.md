When you act as the head of a team you can either lead them or manage them, but which is the better approach? Let’s discuss this crucial question.

Today I’d like to discuss an important concept: leading versus managing.

If you’ve ever been part of a team, you’ve almost certainly encountered one, or both, of these leadership styles. The way a team runs under each will be different, and noticeably so.

So what is the difference between these concepts?

First, managing means that the person in power is simply barking commands. Leading, on the other hand, is all about inspiring those who look to you for guidance.

Rather than simply telling people what to do, leading is all about guiding people toward the right decisions. This is the leadership approach that helps teams succeed.

For those of you who have a team or are interested in growing one, we would be happy to help you more fully understand how having the right leadership philosophy can benefit a collaborative environment.

Giving your team goals and allowing them to be part of the creative process will improve the results you see from their work. Your team members should feel as if you trust them, and as if they have the power to work autonomously toward the team’s larger objectives.

As a leader, your task is to educate, guide, and work alongside your team. Lead by inspiration, not by orders.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

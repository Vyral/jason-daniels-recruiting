I meet up-and-coming business owners all the time and they sometimes ask me what it requires to be a successful entrepreneur. I’d like to share my thoughts with all of you today.

**Basically, it all boils down to determination.** You have to make sure that you’re determined to achieve the goals you want. It’s not all about the money or the fame, it’s about serving others. If you can provide a value for someone that’s higher than what they’re already paying for, then you’re going to be a true success.

It takes a lot of grit and you have to grind daily. It all starts out in the morning and having a strong routine. Learn more about that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHeOpEp93v8&amp;feature=youtu.be){: target="_blank"} in a recent video we did.

Another lesson I take with me is from the book Traction by Gino Wickman. In a nutshell, it talks about being successful in a strategic way. You have to make quarterly goals to move your business forward and if you don’t, things will remain stagnant.

For real estate, you need to make sure you're contacting clients, people who know you, and new people. **Consistency is key, though, and you need to dedicate a lot of time to perfecting the process.**&nbsp;

I like to tell people that I’m part-time, I just have to pick the 12 hours a day I’m going to work. Of course that’s a little tongue-in-cheek, but there is some truth. To get things off the ground floor, you’ll have to put in long hours, but if you do and you stay focused, you’ll be able to greatly reduce that time because working that much simply isn’t good for you or your family.

If you have any questions for me about what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

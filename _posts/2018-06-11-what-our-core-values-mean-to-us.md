Every business owner needs a set of core values. Here are our core values and what they mean to us.

Today I want to talk to you about core values. Every business owner should have a set of core values that drive the way they do business. Here are the core values we have at RE/MAX Millennium:

{% include pullquote.html %}

• We always do what’s right, even when nobody's looking.

• We put people first. People before profits.

• We hold people’s names sacred. We have a no-gossip policy here and we will not tolerate it.

• We’re always teachable and learning. That is why we really embrace skills training, education, and personal growth. We are one of only a few brokerages in town that does this type of program.

• We laugh and we have fun. We are all here to make money, but we have to have fun too.

• We are grateful.

• We are real and transparent. No facades here. You get what you see with us.

• We are one. We are all a team here at RE/MAX Millennium. Anybody in our office can help you and answer any questions at any time.

Those are our eight core values here and it is how we dictate our interactions with our team, our clients, and our community. If you have any questions about our core values or how to create your own, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

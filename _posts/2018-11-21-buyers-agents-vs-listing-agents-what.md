People just entering the real estate industry may wonder what role within the profession would be best for them. Actually, the best way to answer this question is by asking yourself a couple of others. For example: Do you want to be on a team? If so, becoming a buyer’s agent or a listing agent may be a good option. Being a listing agent will allow you to leverage your time, money, and efforts more quickly, but most agents start out working with buyers. If you’d like to learn more or have any other questions, we would be happy to schedule an appointment and talk about this topic in greater depth.

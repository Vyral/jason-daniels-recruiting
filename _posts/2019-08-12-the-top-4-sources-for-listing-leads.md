<center>What are the best sources for listing leads? Find out today.</center>

&nbsp;

There are many different places an agent can find business, but when it comes to finding listing leads, these four sources stand out above the rest:

**1\. Your sphere of influence**. Staying in touch with your sphere of influence is incredibly powerful. You must always let them know that you’re never too busy to take on their real estate needs, or their referrals.

**2\. Your professional network**. Over time, real estate professionals build a lot of relationships with fellow Realtors from all over the country. By maintaining these relationships, you’re likely to attract referrals from agents who have been approached by clients looking to buy or sell outside of their market. This is especially effective in areas with military bases, which attract a large number of out-of-state families.

**3\. FSBO sellers**. People who are interested in selling their property on their own generally end up needing more help than they expected. Studies show that more people have turned to Realtors for professional help than was true during any given year over the last decade. Although listing online has become easier for sellers to manage on their own, the rest of the home selling process has become more complex. The demand for professional help in the real estate industry has never been higher.

**4\. People who have previously failed to sell**. The biggest mistake someone who has failed to sell in the past can make is to try the same approach again. Working with a new agent (like you) will be in their best interest, and if you can convince them of this, you’ll find that this demographic of sellers is an incredible source of leads.

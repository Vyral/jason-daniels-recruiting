If you want to grow your business, you need to have a productive work environment.

Some agents like to work from home, and that’s okay. Others like to have their office in an office. Here at RE/MAX Millennium, we offer both options. Either way, you’ll find a great work environment, and in our office, we have a cafe space, inviting decor, and a wonderful administrative team to support all our clients.

In any case, here are a couple tips to help you ensure a productive work environment.

{% include pullquote.html %}

If you work from home and that’s important to you, you should treat your workday just like you would anywhere else. If you’d wear a suit and tie to the office, wear a suit and tie at home. Dress how you’d normally dress, whether you have an appointment or not. Otherwise, you might find yourself sitting on the couch with a bag of Doritos watching TV when you should be prospecting.

It’s also important to have a regimented schedule when you work from home. If you have small children at home or you don’t have your own workspace there, you need to make sure you have a space in the office where you can actually get work done. Stay focused and don’t let yourself get distracted by emails or your smartphone (it’s not so “smart” if it’s distracting you).

Studies have shown that there’s no such thing as multitasking, so take 60- to 90-minute periods throughout the day to focus on one thing. I promise you that if you do this, your productivity will increase, and I have plenty of other productivity hacks that I’d be happy to share with you if you’re interested.

If you have any more questions about how to create a productive work environment or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to give me a shout. I’d be happy to help you.

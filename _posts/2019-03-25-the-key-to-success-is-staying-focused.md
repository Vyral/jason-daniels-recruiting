We’ve found that with all these new tech toys and social media platforms, there are so many distractions in the world of real estate.

To help hone their focus, I have our agents sit down and write out the top three areas they want to focus on in their business. Once they figure out what they want to do, whether it be FSBOs, expireds, internet leads, or working by referral, we challenge them to divert their focus to those three areas. If they’re a new agent, we ask them to pick three pillars of business that they think they’d like.

We have different advanced courses where we can break up the year, but concentrating on three areas is a good way of keeping things simple.

But what does it mean to focus?

For our part, my team likes to come into the office, get their things ready, do a quick team huddle to see how things are going, and then do a little bit of script and role-play practice.

<br>From 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Monday to Friday, also called our “power hour,” our focus is on the phones, where we call our internet leads and personal spheres to work referrals. During that time, we also write handwritten notes to thank our clients and those who are referred to us.

After the power hour, we go over scripts and role playing again, just to see how things when.

From there on out, the agents go off to do whatever they need for the rest of the day—listing appointments, buyer appointments, inspections, and so on.&nbsp;

The great thing about this system is that by the time our agents are free to go out and complete their tasks, they’ll already have done the most important thing of the day, which is focusing on new business and new client acquisition. Both are key to maintaining success.

If you have any questions about focusing on what matters the most in our business, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;

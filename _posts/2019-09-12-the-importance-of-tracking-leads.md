Regardless of the industry, every business owner should track where their revenue comes from, and real estate agents are no different. You have probably heard this before, but you truly need to be tracking your leads.

Why?&nbsp;

The bottom line is that tracking your leads helps you to make sure that you’re spending your money and your time wisely. All you need is a simple spreadsheet to determine where your clients are coming from. If you identify that most of your clients tend to come from a certain source, you can then redirect your time, money, and energy accordingly.

If you’re tracking your leads and leveraging your resources correctly, you should be making at least twice as much as you’re spending. If something isn’t bringing you a high return (or any return at all), then it may be time to scratch it off of your schedule.&nbsp;

Once you get the hang of tracking your leads, you may find it beneficial to invest in CRM software that will do it for you. It’s all about finding what makes sense for you and your business.&nbsp;

Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can help grow your business if you do it the right way.

With all of the different social media platforms out there, using them to grow your business can feel overwhelming. However, leveraging platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram (to name just a few), can be quite effective. The key is to be consistent.

Make sure that you are posting on a daily or weekly basis, and that your posts are appropriate. While it should mostly be business-related, you can also occasionally include personal touches. This way when people Google your name, they’ll be able to learn a little about you before meeting up with you for a listing appointment.

If you want to keep your private Facebook life locked out, that is fine. That said, creating a Realtor Facebook page or business page will greatly benefit your business. And, if you’re comfortable doing so, adding in the personal things to your real estate page will help others see you as a real person.

Beyond posting, watch your clients and keep in touch with them to change an online situation into a personal situation. You can wish them a happy birthday or send them gifts when they have a new baby. This is especially important if they are someone who would refer you business. Taking these steps will help you build a long-term relationship.

Online interactions with clients can be turned into a source of referral business. The more you do this, the more you are going to win. Of course, you can buy internet leads, but I’m a fan of working by referral and building relationships with clients both online and off.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

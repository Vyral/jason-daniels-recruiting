We recently held our Peak Mastermind Summit here in Colorado Springs and had a fantastic time. We hope all of you who joined us did as well.

We recently held our Peak Mastermind Summit, and it was a resounding success. I started promoting it because I wanted to bring together small businesses and put on a great event with a national speaker without having to drive to Denver. Through technology, marketing, and networking, we all learned a lot about what it takes to grow your business in today’s economic climate. We’re so happy that so many of you were able to join us.

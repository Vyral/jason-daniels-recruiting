As the broker owner of RE/MAX Millennium, I would like to share with you the benefits of working with us as a broker/owner.

What value can our brokerage provide you?

We have the best value given our fees here at RE/MAX. In fact, the average agent here in Colorado Springs sells about 6 homes per year, but our agents sell over 26 homes per year on average.

There’s a reason for that: One of the No. 1 things we focus on here is training, which is covered for you. We do weekly and monthly trainings, though none of it is mandatory if you don’t want to participate.

We also strive to keep things fresh and new. Other brokerages in town rehash the same materials over and over.

RE/MAX Millennium makes an active effort to be on the cutting-edge technology, which is critical for your success, especially with the way the market is shifting.

On top of that, we have administrative staff who help you from the front end by greeting your clients, as well as the back end, where they take care of all your paperwork and ensure that you’re compliant with laws and procedures. We’re willing to hold your hand as much or as little as you like throughout the process.

Finally, we have, hands down, the nicest office. This is not me boasting—I have been told this by many people. We even have an open cafe space where our agents can hang out together with clients. We also host our client appreciation events and parties right here in the office.

Our brokerage prides itself on building a community in which our agents know that they’ll help each other out. In fact, among our core values as a company are transparency and willingness to help others.

These are just a few snippets of the values and benefits you stand to gain by working with us here at RE/MAX Millennium. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us here. I’d be happy to have a conversation with you.

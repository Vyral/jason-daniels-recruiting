<center>A few tips for new or aspiring entrepreneurs.</center>

&nbsp;

What does it take to become a successful entrepreneur? I’m often asked this question by fledgling business owners, and it’s no wonder: Entrepreneurship comes with its fair share of risks. Because of that, developing good habits and practices right from the word go is very important.

Above all, success in your entrepreneurial pursuits depends on your&nbsp;**determination**. You need to make sure you’re determined to achieve the goals you set out to achieve. More than just fame or fortune, it’s about your value proposition. If the value of what you’re selling goes above and beyond what people are paying for it, you’re sure to succeed.

In one of my previous videos, I discussed the importance of being an early riser and sticking to a morning routine, which is a key ingredient in your success as an entrepreneur as well. If you missed it, you can check it out&nbsp;[here](https://coloradospringsrealestatecareers.blogspot.com/2018/10/3-keys-to-making-your-morning-routine.html).

In addition, I’d recommend reading the book&nbsp;**“Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business” by Gino Wickman.**&nbsp;In it, he provides a blueprint for strategic planning and setting quarterly “rocks” or goals. Whether you’re just now getting your business off the ground or you want to take it to the next level, reading this book will help you map out where you want to go.

Your&nbsp;**focus**&nbsp;will also be instrumental to your success. The more you focus on fine-tuning your sales and marketing, the more your focus will expand to not only reach the people who know, like, and trust you, but to create new lines of communication with people in the marketplace.

You’re probably wondering how many hours a week you’ll have to dedicate. It’s important to discipline yourself to treat entrepreneurship as a job. When you’re first starting out, you can probably&nbsp;**expect to work 10 to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week.**&nbsp;Eventually, you’ll need to return to a healthy work-life balance, but in the short term, being an entrepreneur will demand your undivided attention and a lot of time, energy, and effort.

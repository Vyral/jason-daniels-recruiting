Agents often ask me what the purpose of circle prospecting is, so let’s get to the bottom of this common question today.

Before we get to this, though, allow me to quickly define circle prospecting for those who may not know.

**Circle prospecting is essentially a method of contacting potential leads by reaching out to people within a certain mile radius around a particular home.&nbsp;**One of the most common ways to do this is by purchasing and calling reverse directories.

Now that we’ve covered what circle prospecting is, let’s move on to what its purpose is. There are actually many different reasons an agent might use circle prospecting. You may use it to advertise open houses, let buyers know about local listings, or to see if anyone in a given area is interested in selling their home.

**The bottom line is that circle prospecting brings you business.&nbsp;**Circle prospecting will mostly bring you sellers, but it can bring in buyers, as well. All in all, it’s a fantastic technique all agents should utilize.

If you’re wanting to get into the real estate business, there are a few options you have when you’re first starting out. Today, we’ll be discussing the ways you can begin your career as a Realtor.

To earn your license, you’ll typically go attend a course for around three weeks and for eight hours a day. You’ll then take a test a become a licensed real estate agent. Here in Colorado Springs, there are several in-person programs you can choose from. My agents have found success in Kaplan, and I personally recommend this option. On top of in-person classes, they also have an online component and correspondence courses. Other real estate schools usually have these components as well.

However, I’ve found that agents who take the online and correspondence routes struggle to pass their tests. This is primarily because they’re missing out on vital interaction with an instructor and other benefits of the classroom setting. Correspondence courses, where students are essentially just reading a book, show high failure rates. The online component fares a bit better, but neither option compares to the in-person experience.

Kaplan’s in-person courses see students passing the first or second time, compared to other options where tests are often retaken multiple times. If you want to be better prepared for the final exam, you want to devote three weeks and show up to an in-person class.

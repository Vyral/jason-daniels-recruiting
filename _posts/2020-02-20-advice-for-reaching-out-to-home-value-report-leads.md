I wanted to quickly reach out to talk to you about the follow-up process for a home value report. Most of these websites will send out an automated report, but sometimes it will just be an email to you with the information. You definitely want to follow up immediately and treat them like a normal internet lead. Thank them for registering for your website, let them know about their automated value report, and that you can come out to do an analysis for a more detailed evaluation. To learn more about the process and some best practices, watch this short video.

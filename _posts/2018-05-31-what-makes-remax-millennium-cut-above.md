There are many different things our team members cite as being their favorite aspect of RE/MAX Millennium. For some, it’s the teamwork-focused atmosphere, and for others, it’s great energy, or the knowledge that team leaders truly care about everyone’s success.

I’ve been selling real estate for nearly 15 years, but when I opened RE/MAX Millennium it became apparent that there were certain things I was ready to do differently. My team and I were able to redesign our office space and our core values around how we want to run business—which is essentially just an amplified version of what we were doing before.

So far, our team has loved what these changes have done for us and our clients. Broker associate Ron Mast, for example, has been in real estate and the mortgage industry for over 30 years, and he specifically chose to work with us at RE/MAX Millennium because of our great atmosphere.

And our clients love what’s going on at RE/MAX Millennium, too. According to team member and broker associate TJ Chambless, clients are always complimenting our office’s design and technological resources.

But our office isn’t all we’ve got going for us. Broker associate Jenny Daniels points to our team itself—our people—as being an invaluable resource to clients.

The list of benefits our team brings to the industry goes on and on. Broker associate Alan Daniels says our energy is one thing he personally values about working at RE/MAX Millennium. “It’s a great place to bounce ideas off of each other,” he says.

This sense of collaboration is so strong, in fact, that broker associate Marsha Meyer has said working for our team is like being part of a family. “Everyone really cares about making sure that I’m succeeding,” says Marsha.

It’s easy to see that our RE/MAX Millennium team is a cut above the rest. So many of our agents have great things to say about what it’s like to work here, like broker associate Brian Daniels, who says that RE/MAX Millennium “offers more than the average RE/MAX brokerage.”

Specifically, one of the most significant things RE/MAX Millennium offers its agents is an emphasis on continued education, training, and support.

As for myself, I’m just grateful to be able to provide these opportunities for my team and our clients. Agents here at RE/MAX Millennium have the chance to grow as professionals, all while drawing upon the experience of other successful agents all around them.

At RE/MAX Millennium, we hold high ethical standards, provide high levels of support for our agents, and are always working to treat people right. So, if you’re thinking of making a career move, why not consider joining us? We’d love to show you where all this high praise comes from.

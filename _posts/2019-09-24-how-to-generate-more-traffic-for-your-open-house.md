How do you market your open house to generate more traffic?

There are a lot of ways to advertise an open house, but the days of just placing an ad in the newspaper and putting up a few signs are over. With that in mind, I want to share with you the steps my team and I take for all our open houses that always generate a lot of traffic.

First, **you must advertise your home online.** There are a lot of websites (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.) that allow you to do this, in addition to the local MLS. Also, whenever we do an open house, we email every agent who has sold a home in that ZIP code and invite them and their clients to attend. Additionally, we use paid advertisements for the property on Facebook.

After that, we call residents in the surrounding neighborhood and invite them over. If we have time, we’ll knock on the doors of the same houses we’re calling and hand these people a personalized invitation.

**Sometimes, we’ll host a private open house for neighbors only, which allows our agents to meet with them before the general public is invited.** The people who attend this pre-open house might be thinking about selling themselves and are on the lookout for a good agent, so not only are you attracting traffic to your current listing, but you’re also attracting other future seller clients.

If you have any more questions about how to generate traffic for your open house, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

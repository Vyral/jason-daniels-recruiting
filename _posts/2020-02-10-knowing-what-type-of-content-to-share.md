<center>Not all content is good content. Today I&rsquo;m sharing how to know the difference and better engage with your sphere.</center>

&nbsp;

As a real estate agent, it’s important that we engage with our sphere regularly. The challenge with that, of course, is crafting meaningful content that provides your clients with value. Here are some tips for content creation:&nbsp;

**Educate your audience about the housing market, real estate, and upcoming listings.** Highlight interesting trends in the housing market and offer expert analysis and predictions. We don’t want to just repeatedly send them listings—they can look for those elsewhere. While it’s important to occasionally send them listings so that they know you’re actively involved in the business, adding the extra touch of, say, a video blog or an interesting social media post can be impactful.&nbsp;

Obviously, whatever you send out—whether via postcards in the U.S. mail or newsletters via email—should be carefully thought out. There’s an infamous story about an agent who sent out recipe cards for 10 years, only to find out that someone in their sphere all along chose a different Realtor for their home sale. When confronted, the person told this agent, “Oops, I forgot you were a Realtor. I thought you were involved with some cooking school.”&nbsp;

That story illustrates **the importance of keeping your content industry-related.** On your personal social media accounts, follow this general rule: Make one business post for every three to four personal posts. Don’t overrun your personal page with business, as it will likely annoy your friends and potential clients.&nbsp;

Buyers and sellers, millennials especially, want to see that you’re a real person and not some scam; you need to be active on the most popular social media platforms. On them, you can highlight local businesses or plug upcoming client events. Truly, there’s no limit to the amount of valuable information you can share with your sphere.&nbsp;

Please reach out via phone, email, or the links below. I’d be happy to talk with you about how to best contact your sphere and strengthen your business relationships.&nbsp;

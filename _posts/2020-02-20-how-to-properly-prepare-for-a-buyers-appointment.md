Today I’m going to show you how to properly prepare for a buyer's appointment. I encourage you to have the buyer meet you in your office to show their level of commitment to working with you. If your office is a bit of a long commute, you can meet at a coffee shop or other neutral location that’s closer to them. Keep in mind that safety is of the utmost importance here. Make sure you have materials that show the agent why they should work with you and do a little research about the buyer themself. To learn more, watch this short video.
